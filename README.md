# E-Commerce React 

## Description:
Rose and Lily MERN application, custom boutqiue. Can add items to the cart, filters down on items, I have added stripe for easy payment (just in test mode), sign in with username and password or google sign in.  

## Motivation:
I have always wanted to create an online website, because shopping is one of my favourite things, and because of that I was able to really visualize how I wanted it, the data flow and what should go into the redux store. 

## Deployed Site:
https://65ba4085942a7100087be5bc--superb-croquembouche-bbcbcb.netlify.app/

## Technology Used:
Front End:
- React
- React Redux
- React Router Dom
- Styled Components

Back End:
- Firebase

Extras:
- Stripe

## Future Development:
I would like to make it more robust, such as creating an actual product page when you click on the product.
